# Documentation Chain (Work In Progress) 

## Purpose for the project 
I have recently finished University and are wanting to keep improving my skills why looking for jobs, creating a project using new technologies while improving on my current skills. 

## About 
This project aims to be able to store documentation securly and allow people to check the documentation to make sure it is valid. 

For example, important Documentation like wills get fordged and people struggle to get access to the documentations, however by storing the documentation on something like the blockchain it ensures the documentation cannot be changed and can be easily accessed. At the start of the project the aim is too create something like this without using the blockchain (prototype).
